## About The Project

This is a simple and minimalistic portfolio website to showcase my projects built with GatsbyJS.
Why Gatsby? Honestly, gatsby is little overkill for a site this small, but still, I wanted to use it because of the speed and developer experience gatsby delivers.

### Built With

Technologies I used to develop this project

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.org/)
- [Netlify](https://Netlify.com)
- [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

## What I learned

I learned from this project a lot! Starting at zero knowledge of GatsbyJS and a basic understanding of react, I think I have a good grasp of how things are working. Also, this was the first project where I used CMS of any kind, I've picked netlify cms because of its great documentation and a great connection with gatsby graphql API. Speking of graphql, this was my first encounter with graphql, and I absolutely love it! I see why so many big companies are starting to use Graphql instead of rest API.
If I would change something maybe I would build this site with styled-components instead of SASS, but other than that, I think the site looks and feels great. I can easily say I'm proud of it.
