I'm an 18-year-old web developer livin' in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland.

I've been learning how to code for about a year now mainly focusing on frontend stuff but in the future, I see myself more as a full-stack developer.

I love the feeling of not knowing something and searching the internet for hours to find out more about this something. Below you can see my tech stack and the technologies I'm currently learning.
