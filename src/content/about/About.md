I'm an 19-year-old web developer livin' in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland.
<br />
I've been learning how to code for about a two year now mainly focusing on fullstack web development.
<br />
I love the feeling of not knowing something and searching the internet for hours to find out more about this something.<br />
